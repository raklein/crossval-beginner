# crossval-beginner

This repository was created for the RKTS Workshop in Bordeaux (Sept 2018). It assumes nearly zero R experience and walks through a very basic example in cross validation.

You can run this script without installing anything with the web version here: https://rstudio.cloud/project/66369. (Login required - free right now but R Studio cloud indicates they may start charging at some point).

# To use the web version:
1. Follow the link above.
2. Login (create account or login with Google or Facebook)
3. Click "script.R" in the "Files" window on the bottom right.
4. Proceed to run each line of code in the browser.
Working as of 9/7/2018, but RStudio Cloud is still in alpha.

# To download and use on your local machine:

1. Ensure you have [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) AND [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installed.
2. Download this repository to your computer by clicking the green "Clone or Download" button above, download the .zip file, and unzip it to anywhere on your hard drive. (Git savvy folks can instead fork and clone the repo if they wish - ask Rick if you want a demonstration).
3. Open crossvalidation-beginner.Rproj in R Studio, this will automatically set the working directory to wherever the .Rproj file ([more info on using R Project files](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects)) is located on your hard drive.
4. Open the r script script.R in R Studio by double-clicking on it (either in the "files" window of R Studio, or from your hard disc and select open in R Studio).
5. From here, you should be able to simply run the R script from start to finish without any edits. I highly recommend running the code line-by-line and trying to understand what's going on. Don't heisitate to ask questions.
